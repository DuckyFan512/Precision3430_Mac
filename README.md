My system details:

Model: Dell Precision 3430
CPU: 8th gen Intel i7-8700
GPU: Intel UHD 630
RAM: 32GB
Storage: 512GB NVME

What works?
- Boots MacOS
- Ethernet
- Sound
- Login to Apple Account
- Use Private Relay

What doesn't?
- Secure boot is disbaled
  - Messages integration, Facetime etc will not work
  - This is probably worth fixing :) but turning this off made it boot so I gave up
- Wifi? I'm not even sure if this hardware has wifi
- Bluetooth? Same as above.

What hasn't been configured?
- Discrete AMD graphics support, again probably worth doing for eventual cheap upgrade
